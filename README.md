## PyShell
PyShell is an interative web based python tutor. It is built upon Web2Py MVC framework. It contains support for Google App Engine Hosting. All of the backend is written in Python and the front end is a mixture of javascript tricks. We have made a good use of [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net), a fabolous javascript library to build our web based editor. For the beauty aspects [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) came in handy. Most of the code is in the following files
1. controllers/default.py - Contains most of the controllers including the code for running python shell.
2. controllers/db.py - New and standard database definitions and some DB related controllers.
